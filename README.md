# unibot

This is my diploma project made in 2024 at the Universit√§t Kassel.
The main documentation is found under unibot.pdf.

It consist out of a robot chassis with replaceable modules like different motors and sensors.

The 3D models, pictures and assembly notes for the chassis are located within the chassis folder.

Under the modules folder, you can find a collection of example modules and templates.
For most of the modules there are example codes for a raspberry pi pico located in the example_code folder.

For questions and support you can contact me under <emilaltmann@uni-kassel.de>
