# Overview over all modules:

Each module folder consists of:
- at least two pictures of the assembled module
- at least one picture of the inner electronics
- a .3mf file of the 3D printable part
- a schematic as .svg and .kicad_sch
- and sometimes a note about known insufficiencies or assembly notes

The schematics are made with KiCad 8.0.2 (https://www.kicad.org).
All 3D models should be 3D printable without supports
and with at max a 0.8mm nozzle and 0.4mm layer height.
