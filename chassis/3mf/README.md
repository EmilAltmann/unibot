# 3mf files for the chassis

The main chassis consists of two parts.
Each can be printed with only minimal support (see support_for_unibot_rev5_*.png).
The models are designed to be printed with a 0.8mm nozzle at 0.4mm layer height.
The models should be arranged like seen in the slicer preview (see unibot_rev5_*_sliced.png) .
